Welcome to Locally Optimistic -- a blog for current and aspiring data analytics leaders. Started in NYC in early 2018 as an outgrowth of a slack channel / extremely informal meetup group, we hope to share our thoughts / opinions / experiences / trials / tribulations with others in the community.

If you have content that you'd like to contribute (or if you just want to chat about data stuff), please reach out.
