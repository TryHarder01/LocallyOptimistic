## What this post is and isn't
This is not a comparison of attribution vendors or methodologies. There are already a wealth of resources that offer overviews of the attribution landscape. Each company has their own unique attribution challenge and there is no one size fits all solution. Do your research and look at the tools that companies with similar business models use

Instead, this blog offers a framework for Analysts and Marketers to interpret the increasingly complex multi touch attribution market. Use this framework to identify what aspects of an attribution vendor are important to you 


## What's the point of attribution and why is it hard
At its heart, attribution (specifically multi-touch attribution) is a very simple problem - how do I divide credit for a conversion (e.g., pdp view, order completed, customer acquired, app downloaded) and give that credit to various factors that influenced the customers behavior. This is important, because as a effective Marketer, you need to know the ROI of your marketing strategies. In order to calculate ROI you need to have both the cost and the results (not necessarily $s) at the strategy or tactic level (channel, campaign, creative - this will vary by the audience)  

The complexity arrives when you realize you do not have perfect information. This challenge comes in two flavors:
1. Data we can't collect - When someone converts (until we have chips in everyone's brains) we do not know of all the ways they were exposed to our brand (Did a friend tell them over drinks? Did they see a billboard? Did they see an advertisement on an unknown device?). We also don't know which of those events impacted their decision to convert 
2. Data that is collected, but you can't access - The breadth of data collected about us as individuals continues to increase. The social networks and search engines we use know an incredible amount of information about us. These platforms use this data for advertising targeting and measurement. However, the platforms do not expose the raw data to the Analyst / Marketer, instead presenting aggregates


## Introducing the dilemma
In this world of incomplete information, how do you find the most optimal attribution solution (in-house or an external platform) for your business model? To help you navigate this challenge, I have tried to distill the ideal attribution model to five key characteristics. The dilemma is that you cannot achieve all five:

1. Cross-device: Include all customer touchpoints across all devices
2. Granular: Attribution, reporting and data access at the most granular level
3. Neutral: Neutral, third party view of marketing performance
4. Actionable: Reporting and analysis you can actual action on
5. Comprehensive: Reporting and analysis that covers all channels in detail
