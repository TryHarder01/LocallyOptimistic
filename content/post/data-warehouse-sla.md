Yes. Your data warehouse needs an SLA if you want to build a truly data-driven organization. And when I say data driven organization, I mean a company where data is used to drive everyday decisions big and small. This is in contrast to an organization where data is not used at all or people pretend to make data driven decisions (i.e. someone makes a decision and then tries to find data to justify it). In this post I explore the concept of a data warehouse SLA and the people, process and tools you need to successfully implement the SLA.

## What is an SLA?
Here is a text book definition from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement):

 >"A service-level agreement (SLA) is a commitment between a service provider and a client. Particular aspects of the service – quality, availability, responsibilities – are agreed between the service provider and the service user"

SLA is a term you may hear tossed around in many different parts of an organization - from call centers (wait time), to logistics teams (delivery time) to creative departments (production time). It is a commitment you make to directly to your customers (e.g., pizza delivery in 15 minutes) or indirectly [work on this]

At the end of the day, an SLA is a promise - it is a promise to your stakeholders that you will deliver quality, predictable service (e.g., a data warehouse that produces correct numbers) that others can rely on it. Most importantly, it is also a promise to communicate when your service level is compromised (e.g., the data warehouse goes down).


## Why do you want an SLA?
In short, you need an SLA to build trust. Data warehouses and BI systems are often operated by centralized shared services. This means the team that produces and maintains the data does not report to the teams that use the data to operate their area of the business. The shared service relationship is always a tricky one, you need

1. Services provided
2. Expected performance
3. Problem reporting
4. Response time
5. Monitoring process
6. Consequences


### Services provided


### Expected performance
* Speed
* Reliability / data quality
* Ease of use (people should understand it)
* Documentation
* Notification of errors

### Problem reporting


### Response time


### Monitoring process
How do you implement & enforce your SLA?

### Consequences
Lose respect / partnership
