## What is an SLA?
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement):

 >"A service-level agreement (SLA) is a commitment between a service provider and a client. Particular aspects of the service – quality, availability, responsibilities – are agreed between the service provider and the service user"

 It is a promise

## Who is your client
CEO / organizations vs teams

## What are the elements of data SLA?
