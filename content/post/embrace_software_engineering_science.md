Why have analytics and data science emerged in the last 15[^1] years to become critical teams in most companies across a wide range of industries? The conventional wisdom seems to be that data came into existence 15 years ago, it [got sexy](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century), and so we got good at using it. Oversimplifying the rise of analytics like that is lazy, but also means we miss an opportunity to identify reasons for the field's success and steer our teams into those strengths.

Yes, there is more data than there used to be. More of what we do day-to-day ends up in someone's database than ever before, but our present-bias overlooks how much data opportunity there's been for ages. Think intraday stock prices going back decades, sports stats since people cared who scored more points, telecoms, insurers, hospitals, human resources. Records were kept, even in computers, but analytics was not changing the game. So what changed?

I think that the story of the ascent of data science in business must include these two environmental factors which converged to create our current renaissance:

1. Academia is training but not employing hoards of smart folks.
2. Tech companies supplied opportunity and a software-first culture.

The confluence of these two people stories contributed to the rise of analytics and we should do what we can 

## The scientist surplus

I finished my PhD in 2012 and waded into the extremely competitive tenure-track academic job market. I ended up with a post-doc and in 2014 came to New York to check out the industry scene. It was a very different job market experience. Rather than begging science to put my brain to work, I was hearing about one intriuging opportunity after another. 

The NSF[^2] and BLS[^3] have reported that my experience was not unusual. US institutions granted 37% more PhDs in 2015 (55k) than they did in 2003 (41k), but academic jobs represent a shrinking proportion of the employment picture. Depending on the specialty and methodology, it looks like only 10-25% of recently granted PhDs are finding jobs in long term acadmemic posts in recent years, down from closer to 50% in the early 2000's. 

The BLS report sums up the situation as,

> the academic sector is generally oversupplied, while the government sector and private industry have shortages in specific areas



### Tangible examples

1. reproducibility
2. experimentation 
2. theory-driven hypothesis testing

## Software-centric culture

But scientists finding industry jobs en masse is only half of my theory. During this period, the preponderance of new opportunity grew in tech companies. Tech companies are different than the other data-laden companies I mentioned earlier in their belief that software is the ideal solution to all problems[^4]. The analytics teams in these companies adopted tools and ways of working which have 

### Tangible examples

1. version control workflows
2. automated testing
3. reviews & collaboration
4. scalability


Of course, this marriage also involved some shared values including openness and progress through incremental contributions.
