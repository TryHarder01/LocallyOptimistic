# One Size Fits None

People often ask us for advice about building out an analytics organization -- How to structure the team? What skills to hire for? Do we need engineers? What about data scientists? How big should the team be? Unfortunately, there's no easy answer to these questions because the best analytics team is the one that is best able to support the organization as a whole, and different organizations may have very different needs.

In this post we'll discuss some of the different dimensions that are import to evaluate when thinking about how to structure an analytics team, and we'll discuss how those different dimensions led us to build very different teams at Casper and at Harry's. 

## Important Dimensions to Consider
* Ambient technical ability at the company (is the company made up of former software engineers or former creatives?)
* Baseline level of analytic ability (what's the likelihood that a randomly selected person in the company will know how to use a pivot table?)
* Distribution and variance of analytical skills (is there a wide variance where some teams have more skill than others?)
* Engineering support (How much dedicated engineering support can you rely on?)
* Business Intelligence vs Statistical Learning (Are you trying to generate reports for operational measurement or build complex models to feed into your product?)

We'll take a closer look at how each of these dimensions may impact the needs for an analytics team.

## Analytics at Harry's
When I joined Harry's as the first dedicated analytics hire, I was shocked to find that the organization was already consistently performing very sophisticated analyses. Because the team (at the time) was made up largely of former consultants and bankers, there was no shortage of analytic talent at the excel-modeling and visualization level, but there was a large shortage of tools to help them perform their tasks quickly and efficiently. We had lots of self-taught SQL users
but no one thinking about the data models that would simplify their multi-hundred line queries into simple reports. We had lots of complicated excel models, but no way to distribute those outputs to others in the organization. 

Because we had so many people across the team who could self-serve analyses at a very high level, I focused all of my attention on building the tools that could empower each of those individuals to work more effectively. The "analytics" team therefore did very few analyses, but invested a lot of time in software engineering to support the analyses being done by the rest of the organization.
