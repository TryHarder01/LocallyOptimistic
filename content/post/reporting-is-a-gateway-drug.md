I love doing reporting. Well I don't actually love doing reporting, but I love what it can do for an Analytics team. If executed well, reporting can be the gateway drug, resulting in an organization that is completely addicted to its Analytics team. If executed poorly, the Analytics team can turn into a team of reporting monkeys - we all know what that is like. Here is some advice on how to use reporting as a means to create strong stakeholder relationships in your organization.

## Setting the scenario
In November 2014, I showed up at Casper headquarters, then a large one bedroom apartment on Bond St in New York. No one really knew what I should work on and I did not have a great idea of what an Analytics team should do. To top it off, I had limited technical skills (basic SQL, expert Excel) and no ecommerce domain knowledge. At first glance, no one had any reason to work with me - even I struggled to identify areas where I could add value. 

One potential opportunity I did identify was reporting. I noticed that there were quite a few regular (daily, weekly, monthly) reports, typically compiled in Google Sheets or Excel. Creating each one of these reports was a non-negligible chunk someone's time
