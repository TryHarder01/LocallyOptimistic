# Welcome to Locally Optimistic

We are thrilled you have decided to join us.

If you have not already, please [reach out](mailto:kaminsky.michael@gmail.com) to ask for an invite to our slack group. 

Once you have received your invite, please do the following:
* Use your full name in your slack handle (this community will work best if we are all real humans)
* Add a profile photo
* Read our [code of conduct](./code_of_conduct.md)
* Introduce yourself in the #general channel

In slack, remember that channels are free. If you want to start a conversation on a topic that doesn't have a channel dedicated to it, you can create a channel and invite others to join you.

## Blog Authors and Contributors

We are very excited to publish blog posts from current and future analytics leaders on [LocallyOptimistic](www.locallyoptimistic.com).

A few ground rules:
* The editorial team at LocallyOptimistic has the final word on what content gets posted. We reserve the right to reject any post for any reason at any time.
* We do not publish posts that are designed to promote a specific product or service.
* We do not compensate authors.
* We do not take compensation for publishing (no payola).

If you have an idea for a post you would like to write, reach out to Michael Kaminsky or Scott Breitenother on slack, and we will add you to our authors channel where we collaborate on preparing posts for publication. 

* In order to contribute, we will need your github account so we can add you as a collaborator on [the repository](https://github.com/locallyoptimistic/LocallyOptimistic).
* To contribute, you should submit a pull request with your content and ask for a review in the #authors channel. The editorial team at LocallyOptimistic will review your post, and will likely request changes. 
* Once you have made all of the requested changes, we will determine where in the [post schedule](https://github.com/locallyoptimistic/LocallyOptimistic/wiki/Schedule) your content makes the most sense, and will set a publish date. (Note: we may re-schedule your post if we need to in order to ensure a good mix of content and authors.)

If you want to workshop post ideas, we have a channel for that in the slack group at #post-ideas. If you have other questions or concerns, please reach out on slack.
